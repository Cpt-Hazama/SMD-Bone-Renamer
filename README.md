**This requires PyQt to run!**

This program can batch replace SMD bone names, in the event you need to do such a thing. Includes an example bone mapping TXT file, the format is as simple as
```
"oldBone" = "newBone"
```

Not every bone needs listed, only bones that will be replaced. If you find any errors or issues, just make a new issue.
